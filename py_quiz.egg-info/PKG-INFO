Description: MCQ
        MCQ is an interactive quiz game built with Python. The aim was to create and application and learn the basics of python GUI programming with TKinter. As I explored Tkinter more, I thought of developing this simplest game.
        
        The MCQ opens up with multiple choice questions and increments your score with 5 as you answer correctly in the game and reduces 5 points for every incorrect answer. It also asks you for your confirmation while exiting the application.
        
        Installation
        
        To install MCQ! to your system,
        
        `pip install py-quiz`
        
        To run MCQ! just fire the command `py-quiz` in your terminal.
        
        Things To-Do:
        * ~~Create basic application~~
        * ~~Add score counter~~
        * ~~Add questions from JSON file.~~
        * ~~Create a `pip` installer package~~
        * ~~Confirm quit option~~
        * Resize Window as per question length. ( If somebody can help me with this, it'll be great!)
